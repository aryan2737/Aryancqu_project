## List of Tasks

I am **Aryan Patel**, and I worked alone in the project and completed the following activities myself:

1. Cloud comparison analysis  
2. Finalizing which cloud is best  
3. Performing risk assessment  
4. Listing security controls to be employed  
5. Identifying ethical and social issues  
6. Managing the GitHub repository  

## Reflection on Commits and Tasks

Since I worked alone on this project, I made multiple commits that demonstrate my involvement in the Truelec project. This helped me keep track of all the tasks that needed to be performed and acted as incremental updates throughout the project. The commit history screenshot attached above shows individual commits corresponding to each completed task.

## Weekly Commit Participation

Across most weeks, I made commits regularly because I was working individually on the project. Certain major tasks, such as cloud cost analysis and risk assessment, required more time, which occasionally resulted in longer gaps between commits. However, I maintained steady progress to ensure the project was completed on time.

## Reflection on Group Work

Since I worked individually on this project, it provided flexibility in scheduling and decision-making, as I was able to proceed without depending on others to complete tasks. I started with the cloud cost analysis section, followed by the risk assessment, and completed tasks sequentially while committing updates accordingly. However, in future projects, working alone may not always be the best approach. Having team members would allow discussions on the positives and negatives of tasks, improving the overall project quality. Additionally, working in a group would help distribute workload evenly and ensure balanced contributions across team members.
