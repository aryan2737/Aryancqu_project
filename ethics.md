## Data Privacy and Security Issues

For any organization to carry out their business, data is required, which can originate from customers, employees, or third-party users. Similarly, Truelec collects sensitive data that can be categorized as:

1. Personal information of customers such as names, addresses, and contact numbers  
2. Employee details, including HR-related information  
3. Financial details of customers  
4. Surveillance data  

For the above-mentioned data assets, Truelec uses them to ensure smooth business operations. Since the data is collected and processed, it becomes the sole responsibility of Truelec to securely use and store it. Failure to do so may result in unauthorized changes to the data, directly impacting confidentiality and integrity. Various types of attacks can be executed by hackers to gain illegitimate access to data, including phishing attacks to obtain login credentials, eavesdropping on communication sessions, session hijacking, SQL injection and other exploitation techniques, as well as malware-based attacks such as ransomware and spyware. If any of these attacks are successfully executed against Truelec, a data breach may occur, resulting in data leakage.

## Regulations and Potential Impact of Data Breaches

All firms operating across the Australian region are required to adhere to the following regulations:

1. **Privacy Act 1988** for ensuring privacy protection  
2. **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)** for securely collecting and storing data  
3. **Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) Scheme** for reporting eligible data breaches  
4. **Cyber security legislation** for safeguarding infrastructure  

Since breaches can occur at any time, adherence to the NDB scheme is essential. A breach does not only impact the organization but also affects customers, as their data may be stolen and misused for illegal activities. In such situations, Truelec may also be required to provide compensation and support services to affected customers to remain compliant with regulatory obligations.
